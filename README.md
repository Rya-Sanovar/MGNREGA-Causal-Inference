# MGNREGA-Causal-Inference

The MGNREGA act was introduced with the aim of improving employment rates in the rural parts of India. As some of the projects undertaken by the scheme involved making changes to the landscape in terms of water collection, farming patterns etc. it was expected that there would be some environmental/geological benefits too. This project aims to take advantage of publicly available satellite data and evaluate the progression of various indices in regions where NREGA assets have been constructed, in attempt to validate the previous claim.
